# Agent Strategy: Windows vs Linux

Zabbix agents were deployed consistently across platforms while accounting for operating system differences.

## Windows Agents

- Relied on Windows performance counters
- Required additional validation to ensure counters were available and functional
- Highlighted the importance of OS-level readiness for monitoring

## Linux Agents

- Provided immediate metric availability
- Required minimal remediation post-installation
- Offered predictable and consistent metric behavior

This contrast reinforced the need for platform-aware monitoring expectations in enterprise environments.
