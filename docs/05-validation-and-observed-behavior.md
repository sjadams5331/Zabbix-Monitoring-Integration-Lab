# Validation and Observed Behavior

## Validation Approach

Monitoring effectiveness was validated through:
- Confirmed agent connectivity
- Active metric collection
- Triggered and acknowledged alerts
- Consistent host availability reporting

## Outcomes

- All monitored hosts reported expected metrics
- Alerts triggered under defined conditions
- No excessive or misleading alert noise was observed
- Monitoring behavior aligned with design intent

This confirmed that the monitoring environment was stable, predictable, and operationally useful.
